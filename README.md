# Real-time Human Pose Estimation in your browser

# A Posenet demo built using ml5.js 

With PoseNet running on TensorFlow.js anyone with a decent webcam-equipped desktop or phone can experience this technology right from within a web browser.

PoseNet is a machine-learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation.

# Is it even useful?

Well, Snapchat uses these modules for its users. This is possible because they are able to detect posture. 

Also in Simulator video games like tennis, they use Posenet to identify if the shot you just took is correct or not.

# So what is pose estimation?

Pose estimation refers to computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and videos so that one could determine where someoneâ€™s elbow shows up in an image or video.

# How does it work?

You feed an image to the neural Network that has been trained beforehand on Mobile Network and it provides you with 2 things: whether the 
image has a skeleton or a person is there or not and for this, a confidence score gets generated and once it is generated, it starts searching
for the 17 key points and it assigns every key a confidence score.

# Library used:

ML5.js:  ML5.js is based on TensorFlow. It provides immediate access in the browser to pre-trained models for detecting human poses, generating text, styling an image with another, composing music, pitch detection, common English language word relationships, and much more.

P5.js: p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners! p5.js is free and open-source software

# Demo Link: 

Click on the below link either from your cell phone, laptop or desktop with a webcam. Stand in front of the camera at a distance of at least 2 - 3 meters and you will be able to see that the camera is capturing your body movements.
